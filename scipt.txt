Greetings of the day! 

We are team NudgeFudge working on the problem statement 1. Before we get into our solution, we would like to mention that our solution focuses on creating app nudges and triggers. 

For our flow of Nudges, we have segregated nudges into two types: 1. Campaign Nudges. 2. Event driven nudges. 
Let's take an example of a demo application to understand our solution better. say, we have a payments application with a few features. 1. Creating a FD 2. Payment 3. 
When a user accesses the feature of creating a FD for the first time, he is directed to the features of the component as setting up the amount, tenure and more. This comes under campaign nudges, but say you are a long time user of bajaj finserv services and you already have a FD account. This month when you put in your share in the FD account, you triggered an event which was associated with success of payment. This draws out the event driven nudges and might reward you with a cashback for paying through UPI.

When you're on the other end of the spectrum i.e business and product development you are focussed more on drawing customer attention to make out maximum possible customer engagement and interaction within your app. Without mumbling into the depths of how the nudges are setup, you can use our no code solution to add features that have proved promising to capture the customers attention. 
You can simply login into the admin panel and you can configure nudges onto the mobile or web application with minimal to no understanding of the underlying principles. 

=======demo application==========

So far we've covered some context that we need to understand the prototype in functionality, so let's test out our nudges and triggers on this demo application. 

======= in depth architecture ========

We've seen the application in work, let's dig deeper into how it works on the root level. In this architecture diagram you can
